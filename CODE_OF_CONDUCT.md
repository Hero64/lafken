# Code of Conduct

## Our Commitment

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we, as contributors and maintainers, commit to making participation in our project and community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contribute to creating a positive environment include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Accepting constructive criticism gracefully
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwanted sexual attention
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that do not align with this Code of Conduct, or to temporarily or permanently ban any contributor for other behaviors that it deems inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing the project include using an official project email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as a designated representative at an online or offline event. Project representation may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate for the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.

Enforcement actions may include:

1. **Warning**: A private, clear communication that the behavior is inappropriate
2. **Temporary Suspension**: Temporary exclusion from participating in the project
3. **Permanent Exclusion**: Permanent ban from participating in the project

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce this Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other project leadership.

## Reporting Concerns

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by:

- **Email**: anibal.jorquera@example.com
- **GitHub Issues**: [Report privately](https://github.com/Hero64/lafken/security/advisories)
- **Discord/Chat**: Contact a moderator

Those reporting are expected to act in good faith and provide sufficient information for the team to properly investigate.

## Confidentiality

The team commits to maintaining reporter confidentiality in Code of Conduct violation investigations, unless the reporter explicitly requests their identity be disclosed.

## Incident Response

The response process will typically be:

1. **Investigation** (within 48 hours of report)
2. **Communication** to reporter about findings
3. **Decision** on enforcement actions
4. **Implementation** of agreed upon actions

## Appeals

If you believe an enforcement decision was unfair, you may appeal by writing to the project leadership team.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org), version 2.0, available at https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/0/code_of_conduct.html
